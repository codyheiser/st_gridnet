# GridNet: A convolutional neural network for common coordinate registration of high-resolution histopathology images

## Introduction
This is an implementation of the model described in our publication "A convolutional neural network for common-coordinate registration of high-resolution histology images," which was developed principally for applications to registration of data collected during solid-phase capture spatial transcriptomics (ST) experiments.
